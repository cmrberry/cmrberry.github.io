#### Taking time to enjoy and time to reflect

It's been four months since I wrapped up work and went on maternity leave. With the exception of posting a photo on Slack a few days after my daughter was born, I spent the first two months of leave completely disconnected from anything and everything work related. I took Slack, PagerDuty, and my work email off of my phone. I signed out of all of my work apps and accounts, including Twitter. I literally didn't even think about what was going on back in the office. <img src="/img/smiles.png" style="width:250px;padding:7px 0px 7px 7px;" align="right" alt="My baby girl!"> All I did was stare at this beautiful little face and concentrate on making sure both of us were as healthy as possible after all of the excitement that is birth.

The last two months I've been slowly ramping back up: checking in on Slack every once in a while, reading the GitHub blog for new feature releases, and scrolling through our internal team news every few days to keep up with what's going on. Yet as a whole, I haven't done any work in four months... and four months is a long time to reflect on what I do and why I do it.

The main result of all of that time to think has been the decision to leave my engineering role. When I start working again two weeks from today, I'll be coming back from maternity leave straight to the support team I left a year ago. And I'm *so* excited.

#### Excited? About Support?? Really???

In order for any of this to make sense, I first want to clarify what I mean when I say "support". Some of you know of or have interacted with GitHub Support, so this will be more familiar to you, but just in case... Support at GitHub is *not* "Is your computer plugged in?" Nor is it a minimum wage call center. Support at GitHub is part of a community of professionals revolutionizing the industry and changing what people think of when they hear the words "customer support".

In this revitalized world of Support, it's not about satisfaction, it's about Super Fans. It's about connecting with the people that use our products and treating them like human beings instead of customer #4872. It's emotionally charged work, requiring patience, empathy, and stellar communication skills. It's about recognizing that support has a huge impact on the bottom line of the business, both in acquisition and retention. It's a challenging job, and companies that recognize its importance (like GitHub does) compensate accordingly.

With that preface, it becomes more reasonable why someone like me could actually *miss* working in a support role at a company that cares about Super Fans. I miss genuinely helping people. I miss connecting first-hand with the ones we're building for. I miss working on a team of some of the most passionate, empathetic, and caring people I've ever met.
