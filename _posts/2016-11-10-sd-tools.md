*This is the second post in the [Support Driven writing challenge](https://supportdriven.com/2016/10/21/stretch-your-typing-fingers-support-driven-6-week-writing-challenge/). You can find the first piece I wrote for this [here](http://cmrberry.com/blog/2016/sd-history/). Also... I'm not sure why there's a pineapple in the photo, but I'm from Florida, so why not?*

##### This week's topic: _"What tools do you use to manage your tasks and your time?"_

### The big things

I'm part of the 58% of GitHub staff that works remotely, which means my office could be at home or at a cafe or at a coworking space on any given day, depending on my mood. That being said, there are a few things that are an essential part of my setup:

- My computer - Everyone at GitHub gets a maxed out computer of their choice when they join, and I went with a [13" MacBookPro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-2015/) for a mix of portability and computing power. It's been about a year and a half and I'm still super happy with it.
- My monitor - I went with the company standard at the time I was hired, an [Apple Thunderbolt](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MC914LL-27-inch-Thunderbolt-Display/dp/B004YLCKYA) display. This obviously doesn't come with me to the cafes, but we have them in the GitHub coworking space in Manhattan also.
- My desk - I have a [Jarvis](https://www.ergodepot.com/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-laminate.html) sit-stand adjustable desk that I love. I admittedly don't stand near as much as I should, but having the option to still makes a big difference for me.  
- Random ergo equipment - All sorts of monitor risers, laptop stands, standing mats, footstools, the works ðŸ˜„ There are some good ideas [here](http://www.cultofmac.com/411382/best-ergonomic-accessories-for-mac-owners/) if you need suggestions.

### Apps we use at GitHub

There are a huge number of apps and integrations that we use at GitHub that will vary depending on what team you're on. Here are the ones that have my focus on a day-to-day basis:

- [GitHub](https://github.com) (obviously)
- [Slack](https://slackhq.com) for chat
- [Atom](https://atom.io) for text editing / coding needs
- [Looker](https://looker.com) for most of the data work I do
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for video calls
- [ScreenHero](https://screenhero.com) for pairing with coworkers
- Our internal Support ticketing tool, Halp
- A variety of other standards like gmail and the terminal

### Apps for personal workflow

In addition to things that we use pretty broadly in the company, there are a *ton* of apps that have become part of my personal workflow. Here are some of them:

- [Fantastical2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) - My Sunrise replacement ðŸ˜¢
- [Divvy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/divvy-window-manager/id413857545?mt=12) - Helps me divide up my 27" monitor into multiple screen areas. Super useful!
- [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Essential for keeping everything secure without going insane
- [Alfred3](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - I'm a heavy user of Alfred's custom searches and snippets in the powerpack
- [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) - Keeps my computer from going to sleep on video calls
- [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) - Helps me track what I spend the most time on each day
- [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) - Essential for those days where I end up working after 5pm
- [DayOne](http://dayoneapp.com/) - Where I keep track of what I'm doing each day as I do it, so I can post it in our team Slack channel as a recap later

<br>

There are other tools that pop in and out of my workflow on occasion, but I think that covers the heavy hitters. Keep an eye on the [Support Driven blog](https://supportdriven.com/blog/) to see what everyone else is using once the week 2 challenge closes!
