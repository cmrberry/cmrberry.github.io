You don't need to search very hard to find [article](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/25/facebook-diversity-report-black-white-women-employees) after [article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-struggles-to-hack-its-diversity-problem/2015/07/16/0b0144be-2053-11e5-84d5-eb37ee8eaa61_story.html) [condemning](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/new-diversity-reports-show-the-same-old-results/) the [lack of diversity](http://mashable.com/2015/06/08/tim-cook-apple-diversity-women-future/) in tech.

I know, because I used to write about it, too.

For six months, I ran a job board focused on connecting under-represented talent with tech companies that truly care about creating an inclusive workplace. In [Modiv](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414001152/http://www.modivhq.com/)'s brief lifespan, I had the pleasure of working with some of the most inspiring startups and founders in the industry. They were clear and obvious choices for diverse talent to want to work at.

But I always wondered...

What would I do if I was approached by a company that wasn't such an obvious choice? What if a startup that was trying to mend its ways wanted to post on Modiv? What would I do?

## Things Change

I never had a chance to find out what would happen in that hypothetical scenario.

My husband was laid-off from his job in March. I tried for a little while to [make Modiv work](https://medium.com/@cmrberry/getting-over-the-fear-of-failure-whether-i-like-it-or-not-4be6a25b1cb6). If I was single and straight out of college, I could have lived off of ramen and done it...

But I'm not.

I'm a wife. I'm a mother. I'm a woman who is responsible for the well-being of her family, a family that comes before all else. And so Modiv fell to the side and eventually dissipated as I searched for a full-time job to support my little family.

Coming from my position of diversity advocacy, I had high standards for the place I wanted to work. I searched for and applied to about a dozen different companies with excellent histories of inclusivity and commitment to a diverse workplace... and none of them worked out.

This one was not the company I was hoping it was, that one never got back to me, another one just wasn't a good fit for my skillset...

I decided to widen my job search a bit. Selectively... slowly...

Before long, I came across a position that was (to put it mildly) enticing. A good fit for my skillset, an established and growing company, competitive pay and amazing benefits, with a remote position that would let me be around as my baby grows up.

It was perfect. Except for one thing.

It was GitHub, and they had a [history](http://www.wired.com/2014/03/culture-offsets/).

## Companies Change

I think I've read almost every article published about diversity in tech in the last two years. I knew what had happened at GitHub. I also knew that their reaction was far from the typical Silicon Valley, "Quick, hire a lawyer and cover everything up," scheme.

Shortly after Julie Horvath left the company, GitHub's CEO (Chris Wanstrath) wrote a [blog post](https://github.com/blog/1800-update-on-julie-horvath-s-departure) admitting that things could have been handled differently. Admission almost never happens.

Then the company [launched an investigation](https://github.com/blog/1823-results-of-the-github-investigation), and told everyone about it. The media covered that pretty thoroughly.

What the media didn't cover so much was the fact that a week later, Chris Wanstrath wrote another blog. He apologized for not being more transparent (who does that?) and wrote a [lengthy post](https://github.com/blog/1826-follow-up-to-the-investigation-results) detailing the process and results of the internal investigation.

The media also didn't cover the [even-longer blog post](https://github.com/blog/1843-diversity-and-feedback-at-github) he posted a month later that listed each initiative GitHub was building to address their work environment and build a more welcoming and inclusive space.

I also heard through the diversity-in-tech grapevine that GitHub had been working with [Nicole Sanchez](http://vayaconsulting.com/about/), one of the most respected diversity consultants in Silicon Valley. By the way, she's since joined GitHub as the company's VP of Social Impact.

In other words, GitHub is serious about change.

Yet despite all of that, the only reason I found out about these is because I went looking. These are the things we don't read about on TechCrunch. And if you don't know to look for them, you'd never know about the work that companies like GitHub are putting in to change for the better.

## Second Chances

It dawned on me as I was researching whether or not I should apply for the job at GitHub that the very hypothetical question I had never needed to answer with Modiv was now taking the front-and-center in my job search.

So what was my answer? My answer was a question:

> *How can companies fix their diversity and inclusion if no one ever gives them the chance?*

So I applied. And I interviewed via webchat. And when that went well, I showed up for my onsite interviews and [didn't shake hands](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1051760/jewish/May-I-Shake-the-Ladys-Hand.htm) because of my religious customs, and needed special meal accommodations because I keep [kosher](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/142441/jewish/Spiritual-Fitness.htm). And you know what? Not only was it *not* awkward, but it was welcomed and respected by everyone I met that day. Not to mention that half of the people I interviewed with were women, all of whom mentioned over-and-over-again the company's thoughtful and deliberate progress.

When I first applied, I was still nervous about whether or not GitHub would be a place I'd feel welcome. By the time I accepted my offer, I was completely sure that I was getting the chance of a lifetime to join a company that is not only making developers' lives easier, but truly working to make [tech](https://github.com/blog/2010-diversity-partners-for-codeconf-2015) and [the world](https://github.com/blog/2037-github-is-a-proud-connecthome-partner) a better, more accepting, more inclusive place.

So read the news about diversity in tech. But also read between the lines. And remember that for companies to increase those ever-taunting numbers, someone has to be willing to give them a second chance. And giving that second chance could end up being just the thing you were looking for all along.
